I'm Andrea Castellanos. From a young age I knew I wanted to study and make a career in the technological area. I eventually landed on Computer Science and graduated from UC Irvine. I moved across the country to New York City to work at Quovo - now known as Plaid - on the Crawler Team. Outside of work I like to collect enamel pins, play video games, shoot film, leisurely bike, and take care of plants.
